Board Design:
	I would have one constructor for the Board and also one copy 		constructor. The constructor would make a board of 		one set size. 

Methods
	//place the ships on the board making sure they are fully on 		//the board and do not conflcit with other ships
	placeShips()
	
	//update and display
